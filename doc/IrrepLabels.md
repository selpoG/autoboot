# Labels for Irreps

All labels of irreps are defined as follows:

## `G=group[g,i]`

All irreps are labeled by `rep[n]` (`n=1,2,...,g[ncg]`).

`rep[n]` corresponds to n-th irrep in `Irr(SmallGroup(g,i))` in GAP.
The character table can be accessed by `G[ct]` and n-th row is the character of `rep[n]`.

`G[id]` is `rep[1]`.

## `G=so[2]`

All irreps are labeled by `v[x]` (`x` is a real number).

Let `G` is generated by `s`.
`v[x]` is the 1-dimensional representation in which `s` is represented by `{{x}}`.

`G[id]` is `v[0]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=o[2]`

All irreps are labeled by `i[1]`, `i[-1]` or `v[n]` (`n=1,2,...`).

Let `G` is generated by `s={{0,-1}, {1,0}` and `t={{1,0}, {0,-1}}`.
`i[\pm 1]` is the 1-dimensional representation in which `t` is represented by `{{\pm 1}}`.
`v[n]` is the 2-dimensional representation in which `s` is represented by `{{0,-n}, {n,0}}`.

`G[id]` is `i[1]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=so[3]`

All irreps are labeled by `v[n]` (`n=0,1,2,...`).

`v[n]` is the spin-n representation, which dimension is `2*n+1`.

`G[id]` is `v[0]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=o[3]`

All irreps are labeled by `v[n,\pm 1]` (`n=0,1,2,...`).

`v[n,\pm 1]` is the spin-n representation which represents the inversion `diag(-1,-1,-1)` by `\pm 1`.

`G[id]` is `v[0,1]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1,-1]`.

## `G=su[2]`

All irreps are labeled by `v[n]` (`n=0,1/2,1,3/2,...`).

`v[n]` is the spin-n representation, which dimension is `2*n+1`.

`G[id]` is `v[0]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=dih[N]` (`N`: even)

All irreps are labeled by `i[\pm 1,\pm 1]` and `v[n]` (`n=1,2,...,N/2-1`).

Let `G` is generated by `s={{q,0}, {0,1/q}}` (`q=exp(2Pi/N)`) and `t` (reflection by `y=x`).
`i[p,q]` (`p,q=\pm 1`) represents `s` by `{{q}}` and `t` by `{{p}}`.
`v[n]` represents `s` by `s^n` and `t` as-is.

`G[id]` is `i[1,1]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=dih[N]` (`N`: odd)

All irreps are labeled by `i[\pm 1]` and `v[n]` (`n=1,2,...,(N-1)/2`).

Let `G` is generated by `s={{q,0}, {0,1/q}}` (`q=exp(2Pi/N)`) and `t` (reflection by `y=x`).
`i[\pm 1]` represents `s` by `{{1}}` and `t` by `{{\pm 1}}`.
`v[n]` represents `s` by `s^n` and `t` as-is.

`G[id]` is `i[1]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=dic[N]`

All irreps are labeled by `i[\pm 1,\pm 1]` and `v[n]` (`n=1,2,...,N-1`).

Let `G` is generated by `s={{q,0}, {0,1/q}}` (`q=exp(Pi/N)`) and `t` (`Pi/2` rotation).
`i[p,q]` (`p,q=\pm 1`) represents `s` by `{{p}}` and `t` by `{{q}}` or `{{q I}}`.
`v[n]` represents `s` by `s^n` and `t` by `{{0,(-1)^n},{1,0}}`.

`G[id]` is `i[1,1]` and the standard vector representation is `v[1]`.

## `G=pGroup[G1,G2]`

All irreps are labeled by `rep[r1,r2]`
(`r1` is a irrep of `G1` and `r2` is a irrep of `G2`).

`rep[r1,r2]` is a external tensor product of `r1` and `r2`.

`G[id]` is `rep[G1[id],G2[id]]`.
